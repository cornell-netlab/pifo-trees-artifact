type t = (int * Rank.t) list
(* The _foot_ of this list has a bogus value in the int slot.
   We only care about the rank of the foot.

   Another way of writing this type is:
    type t = (int * Rank.t) list * Rank.t
   where the final rank is the singeton foot of the list.
   However, the existing version is a little easier to work with.

    | [] -> "\n"

        (* The integer at the foot of the path is bogus, so we drop it. *)
        Printf.sprintf "_ @ %s\n" (Rank.to_string false r)
    | (i, r) :: t ->
        Printf.sprintf "%d @ %s\t %s" i (Rank.to_string false r) (loop t)
