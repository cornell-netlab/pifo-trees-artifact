synopsis: "Programmable packet scheduling at line rate"
description:
  "A formalism and implementation of PIFO trees, a recently proposed primitive for packet scheduling. Accompanied by an algorithm to compile a scheduler written to run atop of a PIFO tree of some heterogeous shape into a scheduler that runs on a PIFO tree of some other, regular-branching, shape."
